# Three-Stage-BJT-Audio-Amplifier
This project designs, simulates, and implements a three-stage audio amplifier using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). The system amplifies a low-amplitude audio signal while maintaining stable biasing, predictable gain, and minimal loading effects between stages.
